# Front-end components for a fitness app I am working on in React using Hooks.

Currently contains:
- A basic home screen with form functionalities
- A workout component that simply renders an example push workout using Exercise components
- Exercise components that display information about exercises (name of exercise, sets with weight and volume)

Styling will be done when functionality from database to client is up and running. I plan on using Postgres and Node/Express for the other components of this app.
More soon :^)
